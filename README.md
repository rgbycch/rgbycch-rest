# rgbycch-rest
RESTful API for rgbycch system. Rails based API service.
# Initial Development Setup for Mac OSX
1. Install rvm at https://rvm.io
2. Install the `2.2` version of ruby with ```$ rvm install 2.2```
3. Ensure you are using the `2.2` version of ruby with a ```rvm use 2.2``` command.
4. Install the following bundles on your system
```
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install foreman
$ gem install rails -v 4.0
```
5. Check out the codebase.
6. Install [pow](http://pow.cx) with ```curl get.pow.cx | sh```
7. Create the symlink for pow:
```
cd ~/.pow
ln -s ~/workspace/rgbycch-rest
(pow can be restarted by running touch ~/.pow/restart.txt)
```
8. Install the bundle by executing a ```bundle install``` command at the base of the project.
9. Generate your configuration using ```bundle exec figaro install```
10. Get the database up and running:
```
rm db/*.sqlite3
bundle exec rake db:setup
bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
```
11. Start the server
```
bundle exec rails server
```
12. Navigate to the [base of the server](http://rgbycch-rest.dev) and you should see the rails sample start page.
13. Generate a user by executing the following code from the base of the project:
```
rails console
User.create({email: "tom@rgbycch.com",
                          password: "12345678",
                          password_confirmation: "12345678"})
```
14. Ensure that this user has been successfully created by:
```
curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.rgbycch.v1' http://api.rgbycch-rest.dev/users/1.json
```
The user's current session ```auth_token``` can easily be returned at any time with:
```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json,application/vnd.rgbycch.v1' -X POST 'http://api.rgbycch-rest.dev/sessions.json' -d 'session[email]=tom@rgbycch.com&session[password]=12345678'
```
Creating a new player should be as easy as:
```
curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.rgbycch.v1' -H 'Authorization: [auth_token_goes_here]' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST http://api.rgbycch-rest.dev/players.json -d '{"player": {"first_name": "First Name", "last_name": "Last Name", "nick_name": "Nick Name", "dob": "d", "email": "email@gmail.com", "phone_number": "123456789"}}'
```
# Running Tests
- ```bundle exec rspec spec```
# Creating and Recreating the Database
If you ever want a completely fresh install of the db, just clobber it with:
```
rm db/*.sqlite3
bundle exec rake db:setup
bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
```
# Documentation
## swagger
Run the following command to generate the swagger API documentation.
```
rake swagger:docs
```
Once the documentation has been generated, run the server with:
```
bundle exec rails server
```
To view the API docs, navigate to:
```
http://api.rgbycch-rest.dev/api
```
## sdoc
- `sdoc` documentation can be generated by invoking ```bundle exec sdoc app``` from the base of the project.
# brakeman
Run the following command to execute [brakeman](http://brakemanscanner.org/) on the codebase.
```
bundle exec brakeman
```
# traceroute
Run the following command to execute [traceroute](https://github.com/amatsuda/traceroute) on the codebase.
```
rake traceroute
```
# rubycritic
Run the following command to execute [rubycritic](https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic) on the codebase.
```
bundle exec rubycritic app
```
